# TehsTrails with changes from Zotmer
A collection of xTeh.7146's marker packs adjusted to suit my own needs.

The changes are intended mainly for my own personal use, but if you intend to speedrun map completion you are free to use it as well. These pack changes are **ABSOLUTELY NOT** for you, if you want to run map comp at a relaxed pace. Instead you should try the original pack (https://github.com/xrandox/TehsTrails) 

### Requirements for using the pack
Being VERY familiar with the original pack (You can find the original at https://github.com/xrandox/TehsTrails)  
Having all the mounts with all the relevant masteries unlocked  
Having prototype position rewinder (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder)  
Using Notarized Scrolls of Heroics to complete all heroic challenges during the run  
Using [trading post items](https://github.com/xrandox/TehsTrails/wiki/List-of-Trading-Post-Heart-Items) to instantly complete some hearts  
Running map comp as a level 80 with a meta build (as of writing itÂ´s [this power build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAoqRlN0w2qbZlNswGZjOMX7PVA-zRIYR09PINTo2RZlSR1sY1yG-e) and [this build for stacking conditions](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAUprlN0wO6YIhMqyGZjO2W%2FvWA-zRRYBRwQGF8DTqCoZE1OIrEIdSADDA-e) or any better build you come up with).

### What is different from the original pack
Several new places for prototype position rewinder  
Some heart guides (along with its zones and trails) updated to use faster speedrunning techniques  
Updated several trails to be faster (mostly longer griffon flights in Orrian maps)
