### Map Completion 
A pack tailored for speedrunning central tyria map completion. It utilizes all mounts, waypoints and a multitude of markers (Nearing 5,000!) to give you the fastest map completion times possible. The current map comp world record of 8h59m utilizes this packs routing!

### Hero Point Train Trails
*Warning! This pack is still very rough, I haven't had a chance to give it much attention since I created it almost two years ago.*

A collection of trails for the routes I used to use for my Hero Point Trains in HoT and PoF maps. Path of Fire can easily be used to quickly get an elite spec solo (~1-2 hours). It's recommend to bring some friends if you intend to do the Heart of Thorns HP's, as some can be difficult to solo.
